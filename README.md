[![Cooked with skillcook](https://img.shields.io/badge/cooked_with-skillcook-d97757)](https://github.com/johnslavik/skillcook)

An [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) that turns any source — a document, a prompt, a chat transcript, an ad-hoc description, code — into one or more working Agent Skills.

When the source covers multiple units of work, skillcook produces multiple skills. When the source is too thin to beat a baseline agent, it says so instead of producing dead weight.

## What it does

Given a source, skillcook:

1. Identifies the unit(s) of work the source covers — and asks the user before silently picking.
2. Drafts a `SKILL.md` per output skill with valid frontmatter (kebab `name`, ≤1024-char `description`, etc.) per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification).
3. Splits detail into `references/` with explicit "Read X if Y" load triggers, and bundles reusable logic into `scripts/`.
4. Validates the result with a strict frontmatter checker.
5. Optionally runs the with-skill / without-skill eval loop so the user gets evidence the skill is worth its context cost.

## Install

Drop the directory wherever your agent client picks up skills.

For Claude Code:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:johnslavik/skillcook.git ~/.claude/skills/skillcook
```

For VS Code Copilot:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:johnslavik/skillcook.git <your-project>/.agents/skills/skillcook
```

The skill needs `uv` for the validator and eval-runner scripts. The eval loop additionally needs an LLM CLI (default `claude -p`).

## Usage

Trigger phrases the skill listens for:

- *"Make a skill from this runbook."*
- *"Turn this into a skill."*
- *"I want a skill for reviewing Python diffs."* (prompt-only — skill will ask follow-ups)
- *"Wrap this conversation as a skill."*
- *"Package this for an agent."*

Or hand it any document and ask for "reusable agent guidance" — the skill triggers without the word "skill" being present.

## Watermark

Every skill produced by skillcook is marked in two places:

- **Frontmatter** — `metadata.cooked-with: johnslavik/skillcook` and `metadata.cooked-with-version: <git-sha>`. Machine-readable; tools can detect skillcook-cooked skills.
- **Body footer** — a small badge linking back to this repo, visible when the SKILL.md is rendered on GitHub.

Both are added automatically by `scripts/new-skill.sh`. Strip them on any individual skill if you prefer; the validator doesn't enforce them.
